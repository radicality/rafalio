#### rafal.io

This is the source for my site located at [rafal.io](http://rafal.io).
The site is static, and compiled with [hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/)

You need Haskell installed to use this. Before running, please have a look at `deployConfig.conf.example` and create your own `deployConfig.conf`. This will be the command that's ran to deploy to your server after running `runghc site.hs deploy`.
